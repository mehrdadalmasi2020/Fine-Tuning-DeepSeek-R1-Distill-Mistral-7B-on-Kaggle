Please show your work step by step.\n\nAlright, so I've got this equation here: 3x plus 5 equals 20. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to solve for x. I remember from class that when you have an equation like this, you need to isolate the variable, which is x in this case. That means getting x by itself on one side of the equation.\n\nFirst off, looking at 3x + 5 = 20, there are two operations happening here: multiplication (3 times x) and addition (plus 5). To undo these operations, I should probably start with the last operation first because of the order of operations‚ÄîPEMDAS or whatever it's called‚Äîit stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So since we have addition last here, I should subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left side.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nStarting equation:\n3x + 5 = 20\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the +5:\n3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n3x = 15\n\nOkay, nice. Now we have 3x equals 15. The next step is to deal with the coefficient of x, which is 3. Since 3 is multiplied by x, I can use division to cancel it out. Specifically, dividing both sides of the equation by 3 will give us just x on the left side.\n\nSo, continuing from where we left off:\n\n3x = 15\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n(3x)/3 = 15/3\n\nSimplifying both sides again:\nx = 5\n\nHmm, so x equals 5? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't mess anything up.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 5 = 20\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides.\nLeft side: 3x + 5 - 5 simplifies to 3x\nRight side: 20 - 5 is indeed 15\nSo now it's 3x = 15\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 3.\nLeft side: 3x divided by 3 is just x\nRight side: 15 divided by 3 is 5\nThus, x = 5\n\nSeems solid. But just to be thorough, maybe plug the value back into the original equation to verify.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into 3x + 5:\n3*(5) + 5 = ?\nCalculate 3*5 first: 15\nThen add 5: 15 + 5 = 20\nWhich matches the right side of the equation, 20.\n\nPerfect! So plugging x=5 satisfies the equation, meaning our solution is correct.\n\nI guess another way someone might approach this problem is by using inverse operations differently. Instead of subtracting first, they could think about what number multiplied by 3 gives a result such that when you add 5, it becomes 20. But essentially, that's the same process as above‚Äîthey're just approaching it from thinking about it as \"what number do I multiply 3 by to get something that when added to 5 makes 20.\"\n\nAlternatively, if I visualize the equation as a balance scale, both sides must equal each other. So to keep the scale balanced, any operation done on one side has to be done on the other. Thus, removing 5 from both sides keeps everything equal while isolating the term with x. Then dividing equally between the remaining parts maintains the balance but solves for x.\n\nWait, did I just repeat myself? Maybe not necessary, but sometimes when explaining things to oneself, it helps clarify the thought process.\n\nAnother point to consider: what if I tried to graph this equation? It would be a straight line, and solving for x would correspond to finding the x-intercept after adjusting for constants. Hmmm... Maybe overcomplicating it, though. For linear equations like this, algebraically manipulating them is straightforward.\n\nBut reflecting on why we do each step: it's all about reversing the operations applied to x. In the given equation, 3x + 5, the order of operations was first multiplying by 3, then adding 5. To reverse that, we'd first undo the addition by subtracting 5, then undo the multiplication by dividing by 3.\n\nThis concept is key in algebra‚Äîworking backwards through the order of operations to isolate variables. It's crucial because without knowing the proper sequence, you might end up with incorrect solutions or more complicated equations than needed.\n\nSo in summary, starting from 3x + 5 = 20, subtract 5 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then\n\n***********************************************\nResponse for prompt 7:\nCan you solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20? Yes, I can. Let's see... First, subtracting 5 from both sides gives me 3x = 15. Then dividing both sides by 3, I find that x equals 5.\n\nSure! So to solve the equation \\(3x + 5 = 20\\), first subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\(3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5\\)\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\(3x = 15\\)\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\(\\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{15}{3}\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(x = 5\\)\n\n***********************************************\nResponse for prompt 8:\nWhat is the solution to 3x + 5 = 20?
